            My name is Eric. I'm a dedicated Web Developer with a passion of learning as much as I can in a lifetime. My hobbies include anything to do with computers, music composition, and art/design. After building my own computer when I was 15, I quickly became enthralled with computer science. I enjoy working with teams, developing relationships with colleagues, and I am always looking to gain new skills to utilize in my work.            </p>
